# Help Wanted

We’re putting together a report on rOpenSci that will include information on our software, peer review, and community, and we’d like to be able to produce as much of it on-demand as possible. Some components can be created from public data, so we created some `help wanted` issues. There’s no competition, collaboration is welcome, and it's ok if people want to try different approaches.

If you would like to work on an issue, please assign yourself. 

Have a question about a specific issue? Ask in the issue thread.
Have a general question? Open a new issue and add the label `question`.

We’d love to see your code and output by Thursday, September 19th. Please share it by adding a link in the issue to your public repo.
