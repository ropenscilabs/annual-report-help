### Original request
Weâ€™re putting together a report on rOpenSci that will include information on our software, peer review, and community, and weâ€™d like to be able to produce as much of it on-demand as possible. Some components can be created from public data, so we created some [`help wanted`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/annual-report-help/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) issues. Thereâ€™s no competition, collaboration is welcome, and it's ok if people want to try different approaches.

If you would like to work on an issue, please assign yourself. 

Have a question about a specific issue? Ask in the issue thread.
Have a general question? Open a new issue and add the label `question`.

Weâ€™d love to see your code and output by Thursday, September 19th. Please share it by adding a link in the issue to your public repo.
